I want to sincerely apologize for allowing my immaturity and selfishness to overshadow what should have been an enjoyable evening for both of us. I understand that my reaction to the deleted video may have caught you off guard. It's no secret that your videos and pictures hold a special place in my heart, serving as a source of comfort and joy. However, I am fully aware that my emotional response was not an excuse for the way I acted. I take full responsibility for my actions, and I am genuinely sorry for allowing my emotions to get the best of me.</i><br><br>" +

I want you to know that I am fully aware of my shortcomings, and I am committed to being accountable for my behavior. I am open to any conversation or action needed to fix this.</i><br><br>" +

I'm sorry for projecting my grumpiness onto you. Above all, I want to reaffirm my deep love for you, Ann. My actions were never a reflection of the love and appreciation I have for you. I am sincerely sorry, and I am eager to work together to find a resolution. If there's anything specific I can do to make amends, please let me know.</i><br><br>" +
